# Air Pollution Nationwide: Air Traffic and Ground Transportation

Project Overview:

We examined the trends in outdoor air quality over the past 40 years based on established air quality indicators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also examined trends in ground and air traffic volume measurements over the same period and used decision tree machine learning technology to see if there was a linear relationship between traffic volume and air quality.

Key Questions:

What are the trends for Air Quality Indicators (AQIs) nationwide over the last 40 years?
What are the trends in air and ground traffic volume nationwide over the last 40 years?
Does the relationship in trends between these two show any connection or relationship?

Background:

Clean Air Act was passed in 1963, with amendments in 1970 and 1990. 
Air pollution is associated with several health effects, particularly respiratory illness.
Air quality measurements for the tristate area (NY, NJ, CT) have not consistently met the U.S. EPA  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

Methods:

EPA AQI Data
EPA Individual air pollutant data (gases)
Texas A&M Urban Mobility Report
Bureau of Transportation Air Carrier Statistics
(Limitations:  Used data available. Note: all years and/or locations not available for all datasets)
Utilized zip_download function to download the large datasets for data more than a decade


Overall:

Air quality in the tristate area has improved since 1980 and over our assessment period (2006 – 2016)
Forty-year data shows consistent increases in the number of Acceptable AQ days and a corresponding decrease in Poor AQ days.
Individual Air Pollutants (average concentration)
2006 to 2009 – consistent decrease
2010 to 2013 – some increases noted
2013 to 2016 – mostly decreasing trend for CO, SO2; some increases noted for NO2, O3
Hospitalizations (Asthma & COPD) & ED visits (Asthma)
Asthma: Increases noted beginning in 2008 with ED visits remaining steady afterwards and a decreasing trend in asthma-related admissions
COPD hospitalizations: Increase noted 2008 – 2011; subsequent decrease until 2015.
Start of increasing trend noted in 2016, which coincides with increase in ozone concentrations.
